<h1>A function's functionality in JavaScript</h1>

<blockquote>
    A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements
    that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function,
    you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to 
    call it. See also the exhaustive reference chapter about JavaScript
    functions to get to know the details.
