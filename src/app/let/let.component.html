<h1>A description of Let in JavaScript</h1>

<blockquote>
    let allows you to declare variables that are
    imited to a scope of a block statement, or
    expression on which it is used, unlike the
    var keyword, which defines a variable globally,
    or locally to an entire function regardless of 
    block scope.
