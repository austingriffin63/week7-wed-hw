<h1>Callback function</h1>

<blockquote>
    Simply put: A callback is a function that is
    to be executed after another function has finished
    executing — hence the name 'call back'. More complexly
    put: In JavaScript, functions are objects. 
    ... Any function that is passed as an argument
    is called a callback function.
