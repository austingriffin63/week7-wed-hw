<h1>Description of Var's use in JavaScript</h1>

<blockquote>
    The var statement declares a variable.
    Variables are containers for storing
    information. Creating a variable in
    JavaScript is called "declaring" a
    variable: var carName; After the declaration,
    the variable is empty (it has no value).
